               <h3>Introduction</h3>
               <p>
                    The Marvel API is a phenomenal tool that allows developers to fetch information about all Marvel
                     comics, characters, and writers. The Marvel API also allows some access to images related to each
                     of those categories. All requests to the Marvel API must be GET requests and the results are returned
                     in JSON format. 
               </p>
               <h3>Official Documentation:</h3>
               <p>
                    Click <a href="https://developer.marvel.com/">here</a> to vist the official documentation page for
                     the Marvel Comic API. There, you can sign-up for a developer account, get your API key, access
                     several how-to guides, and use the interactive API tester.
               </p>
               <h3>Topics Covered</h3>
               <p>
                    The "How-To" Guides on Marvel's site are farily clear, and wherever they might be lacking in
                     examples, their comprehensive interactive API tester should enable the average developer to
                     figure out how to use the Marvel API. However, as noted in the official documentation, the
                     Marvel API and developer websites are still in its Beta phase, and so there are still some
                     problems that you are going to encounter. These problems are not covered in any of the official
                     documentation. First, this guide will make your way around a few bugs in Marvel's developer
                     websites, listed below:
                         <li>No "Accept" Button on the "Terms of Use" When Requesting an API Key</li>
                         <li>Marvel's Interactive API Tester Does Not Appear When Accessed From Marvel's Site</li>
               </p>
               <p>
                    Once you have your Marvel API key and you have access to the Interactive API Tester, you will
                     be ready to start figuring out what you can do with the Marvel API. From that basepoint, this
                     guide will discuss the following:
                         <li>The Basics of Using the Marvel API</li>
                         <li>The Subtle Differences Between Client-side and Server-side API Calls</li>
                         <li>The Basics of and Variations on Image Requests</li>
                         <li>A Note About Character IDs (and other Marvel ID Codes)</li> 
                         <li>Using JavaScript to Download A Complete List of Characters</li>
               </p>
               <p>
                    Finally, this guide will conclude with a few project ideas and suggestions on some ways you
                     might use Marvel's web API.
               </p>
               <h3>No "Accept" Button on the "Terms of Use" Page When Requesting an API Key</h3>
               <p>
                    Marvel's website has a guide on how to get started with using the Marvel API, which can be found
                     <a href="https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/getting_started">here</a>. Naturally, the
                     first step is to create a developer account, which you can do by clicking <a href="https://marvel.com/register">here</a>.
                     Complete and complete the registration using either your Facebook account, Google account, or e-mail
                     address. Once you have sucessfully registered, you will receive a confirmation e-mail. You
                     will need to click the link in that email to activate your developer account.
               </p>
               <p>
                    While setting up your developer account is as straight-forward as it is on any other website,
                     the process of requesting an API key will likely be snarled by an elusive bug. After you have
                     a developer account, you can either click on the "Get A Key" tab at the top of Marvel's page,
                     or click <a href="https://developer.marvel.com/signup">here</a>.
               </p>
               <p>
                    Like you have probably seen a thousand times before, you will be presented with the Marvel
                     API "Terms of Use", and you must read all the way to the bottom and then check the box
                     confirming that you have read and agree to the terms. However, once you have checked that
                     box, you will probably find yourself searching high and low for the "Accept" button. This
                     is where I can save you some time and frustration.
               </p>
               <p>
                    Whether it was designed as an additional security measure to prevent bots from continuously
                     requesting keys, or simply an oversight, Marvel has written their page such that the "Accept"
                     button is hidden by default. In order to reveal the button so you can accept the terms and
                     get your API key, you must right click on the checkbox and click "inspect element". Alternatively,
                     you may press the F12 key to bring up the developer tools, however the "inspect element" method
                     will take you directly to the appropriate lines of the HTML code.
               </p>
               <div class="key">
                    <table class="key">
                         <tr>
                              <th>Before</th>
                              <th></th>
                              <th>After</th>
                         </tr>
                         <tr>
                              <td><img src="KeyRequestNo.jpg" alt="No Button" style="width:450px; height:300px"></td>
                              <td class="middle">=></br>=></br>=></td>
                              <td><img src="KeyRequestButton.jpg" alt="Button Appears" style="width:450px; height:300px"></td>
                         </tr>
                         <tr>
                              <td align="center"><i>as of March 1st, 2017</i></td>
                              <td></td>
                              <td></td>
                         </tr>
                    </table>
               </div>
               <p>
                    Once you have opened the developer tools on your favorite browser, turn your attention to
                     the line of code highlighted in the <i>Before</i> image above. This is the code for the
                     "Accept" button, and you should notice that it has been created with a display style of
                     "none". All you need to do is click (or double click) on the word "style", so that it is
                     selected, and then delete it. If you have done it correctly, the "Accept" button should
                     now be visable, like it is in the <i>After</i> image above. Now, simply click the "Accept"
                     button and you should receive your API key.
               </p>
               <h3>Marvel's Interactive API Tester Does Not Appear When Accessed From Marvel's Site</h3>
               <p>
                    Now that you have a developer account and Marvel has assigned you an API key, you will
                     probably want to start seeing what all the Marvel API can do. The best place to get
                     some real, hands-on practice with the Marvel APIs is the Interactive API Tester, which
                     can be found <a href="https://developer.marvel.com/docs">here</a>.
               </p>
               <p>
                    However, once you reach that site, you will probably start to get the feeling that
                     something is missing . . . again. If you access this page from any link on the Marvel
                     site, you should notice that the interactive API tester does not appear. This is because
                     Marvel has created all of its links with the <a class="code">https://</a> prefix. The
                     plug-in Marvel is using for the interactive tool causes a security issue, and so the
                     <a class="code">https://</a> prefix prevents it from rendering.
               </p>
               <div class="interactive">
                    <table class="interactive">
                         <th>HTTPS://</th>
                         <th></th>
                         <th>HTTP://</th>
                         <tr>
                              <td><img src="InteractiveNo.jpg" alt="No API Tester" style="width:450px; height:300px"></td>
                              <td class="middle">=></br>=></br>=></td>
                              <td><img src="InteractiveWorking.jpg" alt="API Tester Appears" style="width:450px; height:300px"></td>
                         </tr>
                         <tr>
                              <td align="center"><i>as of March 1st, 2017</i></td>
                              <td></td>
                              <td></td>
                         </tr>
                    </table>
               </div>
               <p>
                    Instead, all you have to do is click in your address bar and delete the "s" so that
                     the path begins with <a class="code">http://</a>, or click <a href="http://developer.marvel.com/docs">here</a>.
                     You can also go to your favorite search engine and navigate to the Interactive API
                     Testing page from your search results.
               </p>
               <p>
                    Whichever method you chose, you should now be able to see and use Marvel's interactive
                     API tester.
               </p>
               <h3>Responsible Use of Marvel's API</h3>
               <p>
                    After you have created a developer account you should take some time to re-read Marvel's
                    "Terms of Use" (located <a href="https://developer.marvel.com/terms">here</a>) and read
                    their policies for linking and attribution (located <a href="https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/attribution">here</a>).
               </p>
               <p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0px">
                    <b style="color:red">
                         **Violating the "Terms of Use" or failing to attribute will result
                         in your account/key being banned, and/or legal action. Don't Do It!**
